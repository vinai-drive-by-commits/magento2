# 1. Rationale

When using the Magento 2 UI Components to create admin grids and forms, I always felt like I was dying a bit inside. From my point of view it's an awful system for a number of reasons that I don't want to go into more details about now.


Alternative store fronts that do not use UI components (PWA Studio, Hyvä Themes) are great for frontend developers, but (un?)fortunately I do mostly backend work.

The UI interfaces I create are mainly for store owners and admins.


I desire a way to do my job (which includes building grids and forms) that doesn't feel like I have to fight the framework. Instead, I want to feel empowered and get work done quickly and efficiently.


After years of bitching about Magento, I was very impressed by the work Willem Wigman did with the Hyvä frontend theme. He inspired me to stop complaining and also take matters into my own hands, and finally build the tools I desire. Hence, Hyva_Admin.
