# 04.1 Declaring source search bindings

Sometimes we might want to show a data related to some other entity in a grid.

For example, all orders or a customer. This can be achieved with a `defaultSearchCriteriaBindings` declaration.


Take the the following example:


```markup
<source>
    <repositoryListMethod>\Magento\Sales\Api\OrderRepositoryInterface::getList</repositoryListMethod>
    <defaultSearchCriteriaBindings>
        <field name="customer_id" requestParam="id"/>
    </defaultSearchCriteriaBindings>
</source>
```


This example shows only orders in the grid, where the order’s `customer_id` attribute matches the value of the HTTP request parameter `id`.

It is also possible to specify bindings against methods. However, specifying a binding for a field to match a request parameter is the most common case.


If no default search criteria binding is needed, just omit the tag.


The ways the bindings are declared are best explained by examples:


The most simple example is:

```markup
<field name="customer_id" method="Magento\Customer\Model\Session::getCustomerId"/>
```

The declaration will limit the grid data to records where the `customer_id` field matches the value of the expression

```php
$objectManager->get('Magento\Customer\Model\Session')->getCustomerId()
```


It is also possible to pass parameters to the method:

```markup
<field name="entity_id" method="Magento\Framework\App\RequestInterface::getParam" param="id"/>
```

This example is the equivalent of using `requestParam`. It binds the `entity_id` field to the value of the expression

```php
$objectManager->get('Magento\Framework\App\RequestInterface')->getParam('id');
```


Finally it’s possible to go one level deeper and specify a binding against a property of the methods return value.

```markup
<field name="store_id" method="Magento\Store\Model\StoreManagerInterface::getStore" property="id"/>
```

How the property is resolved depends on the returned value. If it is an array, the `property` will be used as an index of the array, e.g. `$value['id']`.

If the returned value is an object with a matching getter method, it will be called to produce the bound value.

```php
$objectManager->get('Magento\Store\Model\StoreManagerInterface')->getStore()->getId();
```

If that method doesn’t exist, the logic will also try to read the value in a number of other ways (from a public property, or using `getData('id')`, or using array access).


If more complex or chained calls are necessary, they have to be wrapped in a custom class that then can be used in the XML.
